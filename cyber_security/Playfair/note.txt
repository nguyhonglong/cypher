key:monarchy
plaintext:instruments

the playfair cipher encrypt algorithm:
 step 1:
-create a key square with 25 alphabets
-the alphabets must be unique
-usally not using the J
-if the plaintext contains j ,it is replace with i

step 2: 
	+split the plaintext into pair of two letters

		example :
			PlainText: "instruments" 
			After Split: 'in' 'st' 'ru' 'me' 'nt' 'sz'
			-if there is a odd letter,a "z" is add to last letter

			hello
			"he","lx","lo"

		-if there is a double letter ,a bogus letter will be added to the right of the previous letter

	+encrypt:
	if both the two letters are in the same collumn ,take the letter below each one(going back to top  if at the bottom)
	If both the letters are in the same row: Take the letter to the right of each one (going back to the leftmost if at the rightmost position).
	If neither of the above rules is true: Form a rectangle with the two letters and take the letters on the horizontal opposite corner of the rectangle.
